Test Run a single command to rule all your tests, no matter what language or framework.

All you have to do is `go get github.com/johnnye/test-run` then in your project directory run `$GOPATH/bin/test-run`

`test-run` will run the full suites that it can find in `circle.yml` and `.travis.yml` files.
